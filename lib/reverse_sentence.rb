# A method to reverse the words in a sentence, in place.
# Time complexity : O(nË†3) 3 nested loops, cubic
# Space complexity: O(1) in-place
# In-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure
# A small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables
# The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes
# In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements
# N (or n) is the number of characters in the input String
# Input: "Yoda is cool and great ", Output: "great and cool is Yoda"
