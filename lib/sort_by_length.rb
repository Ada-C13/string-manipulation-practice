# A method which will return an array of the words in the string sorted by the length of the word
# Time complexity : O(nË†2) (nested loops)
# Space complexity: O(n)
# Declaring an array of size n (arr) adds to the space complexity by a factor of O(n)
# N (or n) is the number of characters in the input String
