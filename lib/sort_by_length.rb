# A method which will return an array of the words in the string
#  sorted by the length of the word.
# Time complexity: ?
# Space complexity: ?

def sort_by_length(my_sentence)
  # Insertion sort method because it performs best out of the three when working with small arrays, and the test arrays are small
  # Start at index i = 1 to length -1
  # Loop from j = i down to 1
  # If array[ j ] > array[ j - 1 ]
  # Swap them
  # j = j - 1
  # Else break out of the loop
