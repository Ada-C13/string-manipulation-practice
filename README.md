# Sorting & String Manipulation Practice

## Wave 1 - Sort by Length

In this method you will take a string as a parameter.  The method will return an array of words in the string, sorted by length.  Solve the problem without using the ruby `.sort` method.  When words are tied for length, maintain the order they appeared in the original string.

## Wave 2 - Reverse Sentence

In this assignment, you'll design and implement one of the well-known string manipulation methods.
Remember that a string is an array of characters. Algorithms that worked on restricted arrays will work on strings as well.

## Optional Exercise

* Design and implement a method to reverse the words in a sentence *in place*. The string of words to be reversed in passed in as the input parameter to the method.
  * Your algorithm should strive to optimize the space complexity as much as possible.
* For example, if the method is called with input parameter of "Yoda&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome", then the method should update the input string object to have the value "awesome&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoda".
  * Note that the count of white spaces between words is preserved.
* Share and explain the time and space complexities for your solution in the comments above the method.
  * If the complexity is shared in terms of *n*, your explanation must explain what *n* stands for.

**Notes:**
    * Do not use Ruby provided functionality for `.reverse` and `.reverse!`.
    * You may use `.length` method available in the String class.
